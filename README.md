By implementing the Ligon with Line button, your store will provide a frictionless login option to over 200 million users of Line - the most popular messaging application in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, and worldwide.

* Create a more personalized experience for your website users by displaying their photos on any web page. 
* Let your customers share your website with friends on Line and drive more sales and social traffic.
* When customers are ready to check out, let them simply click the "Login with Line" button on the checkout page, which will significantly reduce the cart abandonment rate.
